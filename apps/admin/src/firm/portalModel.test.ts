/**
 * Regression tests for the model behind the firm portal. Two of the three
 * originally-confirmed v14.5 defects still apply directly:
 *  §2b pips 3/4 were unreachable → the indicator is two pips and no view
 *      lights more than that.
 *  §2c access_model was a phantom state → it is absent from PORTAL_VIEWS.
 * The third (§2a, surveyNotBuilt dead code) no longer applies in the shape it
 * was fixed in — Task D's rebuild gives a seat row a REAL entry point (Part
 * 6) instead of a "not built" feedback path, so `notBuiltForSeat` and its
 * test are retired rather than kept alive as dead code. `DESTINATIONS` is
 * checked instead for the same class of defect (a stale "owned elsewhere"
 * label for something this surface now actually builds).
