 * Task D rebuilt FirmPortal.tsx against the real backend (coordinator auth,
 * team, seats, outreach, results), which retires two things that were
 * artefacts of the earlier unwired prototype rather than real design:
 *
 *  - `notBuiltForSeat` — a seat row now links to a real entry point (Part 6),
 *    so there is nothing left to invoke a "not built" dead end for.
 *  - `DESTINATIONS.team` / `DESTINATIONS.results` — both are now built INTO
 *    this surface, so a "not built, owned elsewhere" label for either would
 *    be a stale claim (the exact defect class fixed once before, in Mission
 *    Board). Only `survey` remains: the three firm surveys themselves are a
 *    genuinely different UI (the shared respondent journey shell).
 *
 * `PORTAL_VIEWS` now covers only the unauthenticated claim/sign-in flow —
 * the authenticated portal's own navigation is a separate, simpler type,
 * since a progress indicator only makes sense before a coordinator exists.
