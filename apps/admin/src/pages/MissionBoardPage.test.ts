/**
 * Post-demo findings (§1a/§1b, and the follow-up correction) — regression
 * tests for the parts of the Mission Board page that remain static exports:
 * the severity-rank label map and the navigation rail. Card content itself
 * is no longer static (the page fetches the real, live-evaluated board —
 * see MissionBoardPage.tsx's header comment and App.tsx's wiring), so its
 * copy is guarded where it's actually produced:
 * packages/domain/tests/mission-board.test.ts, "No brief-derived
 * illustration or system-mechanism leakage in card/action copy".
 *
 *  §1a: internal engineering rationale ("folded in — not a separate card",
 *       "(correct, not a bug)", "honest stub") must never leak into rail
 *       copy or the severity labels this page still owns.
 *  §1b: three rail labels claimed "not built" for surfaces that ship real,
 *       routed pages (Regulators — Phase 12, Monitoring — Phase 13, Dragnet
 *       analysis — Phase 16). This test asserts every RAIL entry marked
 *       `built: true` (all six, now) carries no stale "not built" qualifier.
 *  Correction: the severity labels were previously the brief's own §5
 *  severity-table wording verbatim (e.g. rank 2's 'Statistical target
 *  threatened'). They are now freshly written for this screen — this test
 *  guards against that exact phrase, and the same class of phrase,
 *  reappearing.
