/**
 * Phase 17 — UX-RET-007 v2.3 Reminder & Recovery Message Content.
 *
 * Schema:
 *   respondents.reminders_opted_out — structurally separate from consent/participation.
 *   Tapping STOP sets this flag; it never changes submitted_at, consent_accepted, or
 *   any other participation-status field. A stopped respondent remains fully eligible
 *   to return and complete their response.
 *
 * Content:
 *   Seeds the reminder_content area into content_versions + content_live with seven
 *   sub-keys. These are editable via Phase 15's managed-content admin surface.
 *   No WhatsApp variants — superseded by text/SMS platform-wide (DEC-010).
